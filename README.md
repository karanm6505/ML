# Machine Learning Projects

This directory contains various machine learning projects and implementations.

## Subdirectories:

*   **AlexNet/**: This project provides a PyTorch implementation of the classic AlexNet convolutional neural network in a Jupyter Notebook (`AlexNet.ipynb`). It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset for demonstration and covers training and evaluation. AlexNet is known for techniques like ReLU activation, dropout, and overlapping pooling.
*   **KVAE/**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook implementations (e.g., `kvae.ipynb`) related to Variational Autoencoders applied to Kannada alphabets (KVAE).
*   **LeNet/**: This project implements the classic LeNet-5 convolutional neural network in PyTorch within a Jupyter Notebook (`LeNet5.ipynb`). Originally designed for handwritten digit recognition, it uses the MNIST dataset and covers training and evaluation, typically achieving ~99% accuracy on MNIST.
*   **VAE/**: This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Python using PyTorch, trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit generation and reconstruction. It includes `model.py` (VAE architecture), `train.py` (training script), and a `dataset/` folder for MNIST. It can generate new images, stored in `generated_images/`.
